# Final_Project

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

All files, which relates to the project's sections except Geometry, is in Content/FirstPersonCPP/Blueprints.

It has come to me that it would not be opened normally if you have multiple versions of UE4 like me.

Steps to open the Project: <br />
Step 1: Extract the zip file. <br />
Step 2: Switch the version of .uproject to UE4 4.22 before open it. <br />
Step 3: Wait for it to build the project, please show log to see whether it works or not. <br />


  *** This project has been done mostly in C++ *** <br />
** So all the source file is in the Source folder ** 

The Geometry Section is in Content/FirstPersonCPP/Maps
